## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project can be deployed to GitHub Pages using the included GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow builds the site with `npm run build` and publishes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

Steps to enable automatic deploys:

1. Push this repository to GitHub and ensure your default branch is `main`.
2. The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs on each push to `main` and will publish the `dist/` folder.
3. In your GitHub repository settings -> Pages, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (the action will create/update that branch).

Notes:
- The build command used is `npm run build` (Vite). Ensure your `package.json` has that script â€” it already does.
- Because this is a single page app (React + react-router), the site uses client-side routing. GitHub Pages serves static files; if you use client-side routes other than `/`, configure a 404.html fallback to `index.html` or use an alternative hosting like Vercel for full SPA routing support.
